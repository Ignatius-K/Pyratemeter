Hello contributor!, to get started with your contributions for Pyratemeter, here are a couple
of steps to get you started.

Build and Installation
----------------------

  - Fork the Pyratemeter repository to your local github. This means that you will have
    a copy of the repository under your github-username/repository-name.

  - Clone the repository to your local machine using:
    command: ``git clone https://github.com/Pykampala-Community/Pyratemeter``

How do I make a contribution?
-----------------------------

  - To get started, from the project repository check out opened issues.
    These are categorised under different levels of complexity. Select an issue you feel you
    can start working on.

  - Create a new branch off the main Pyratemeter project repository. This is where you work on 
    your changes or fix.
    command: ``git checkout -b branch-name-here``

    or you can first create a new branch by ``git create branch-name`` then switch to the newly
    created branch by ``git checkout new-branch-name``
  
  - Then make appropriate changes for the issue you are trying to address or the feature that you want 
    to add and kindly write tests where applicable to your changes or fixes.
  
  - Use ``git add .`` to add the contents of the changed or added files to the ``snapshot`` git
    uses to manage the state of the project.

  - Use ``git commit -m 'insert a short message of the changes made here'`` to store the contents
    of the index with a descriptive nessage.

  - Push the changes to the remote Pyratemeter repository using ``git push origin branch-name-here``
    or use ``git push -u origin branch-name-here``.

  - Submit a pull request to the upstream repository

  - Title the pull request with a short description of the change made and the issue or bug number
    associated with your change. For example, you can title an issue like so:``added more log outputting to resolve #4352``
  
  - In the description of the pull request, explain the changes that you made, any issues you think
    exist with the pull request you made, and any questions you have for the maintainers. It's `okay`
    if your pull request is not perfect(no pull request is), the reviewer will be able to help you
    fix any problems and improve it!

  - Wait for the pull request to be reviewed by the maintainer.

  - Make changes to the pull request if the reviewing maintainer recommends them.

  - Celebrate your success after your pull request is merged!

  ``Note``: Not more than one change or fix should be associated with just a pull request.
            Therefore, for each new feature to add or change/fix make a separate pull request so
            to make it easier for the reviewer to follow your work.


Where can I go for help ?
-----------------------
If you need help, you can ask questions on the project discussions, thereafter maintainer
can answer you for feedback.
